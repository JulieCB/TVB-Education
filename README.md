# TVB-Education

<p align="justify"><b>The Virtual Brain</b> (<b>TVB</b>; <href>http://www.thevirtualbrain.org)</href> is a free open-source neuroinformatics platform designed to aid in the exploration of network mechanisms of brain function and associated pathologies. TVB provides the possibility to feed computational neuronal network models with information about structural and functional imaging data including population [(stereotactic, S) EEG/MEG] activity, spatially highly resolved whole-brain metabolic/vas- cular signals (fMRI) and global measures of neuronal connections (DTI), for intact as well as pathologically altered connectivity. TVB is model agnostic and offers a wide range of neural population models to be used as network nodes. Manipulations of network parameters within The Virtual Brain allow researchers and clinicians to test the effects of experimental paradigms, interventions (e.g., stimulation and surgery), and therapeutic strategies (e.g., pharmaceutical interventions targeting local areas). The computational environment enables the user to visualize the simulated data in 2D and 3D and to perform data analyses in the same way as commonly performed with empirical data.</p> 

<p align="justify"><b>TVB Education</b> gathers my personal tutorials written either in Python 2.7 (if you are working with the TVB-Distribution: <href>https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei/brainsimulator-software</href>) or in Python 3 (if you are working with the main TVB codebase: <href>https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-root</href>).
